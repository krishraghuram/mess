Todo:
	Code to get card
		If timeout, send an error message and render a error html.
		Note : Store the timeout time in constants
	Write error.html
	Write submitrating.html
	Write thankyou.html
	Write start.html
		Note : error.html and thankyou.html will have javascript that will redirect to start.html
	Migrate the models!!!

Note1:
	Need to read roll numbers from cards in ReadView.get()
	If User.DoesNotExist is raised, need to save RFID and Rollno before sending a error message.
	This way, hostel authorities will be able to know which RFID is which person in the admin site - by looking at the roll numbers.
