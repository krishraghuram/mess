Done:
	Admin Site 
	New User Registration
	
Todo:
	IMPORTANT
	The meal time checking will work only if time is proper
	Also, git commits will cause problems if time is not proper
	Only true fix is NTP :(
	Call JK Ghosh or Guna sir.
	Also remember to set the TIMEZONE in django settings

	Make Pi Screen Work
	Figure out how to multiplex SPI so that two devices can work

	Deploying in apache

	Writing documentation from scratch


Notes on User and Profile creation:
	The user and profile creation process is a bit of jugaad and is not very scalable.
	Both are created in ReadView in rating/views.py
		User is created with
			username=rollno read from ID card
			password="USELESS_PASS"
			user.set_unusable_password to ensure nobody can use passwords. User authentication for RFID systems is the ID card.
		Profile is created with
			user=newly created user
			rfid=rfid read from ID Card
			rollno=rollno read from ID Card
		We are not showing User objects anywhere - neither to admin nor to users.
		They are only used to simplify the internal work, namely - authentication and django sessions.
		The profile object also has name, resident_hostel and subscribed_hostel which are initially empty. The hostel authorities have to manually fill this up.
	
	Initially, we used post_save signal to automatically create profiles. But that creates a problem, as profile.rfid and profile.rollno are both set to be unique. Thus, empty string "" is allowed once for both fields. But if we try to create another user object, the unique condition will raise an IntegrityError. 

	Now, we handle user creation and profile creation both in rating/views.py, in ReadView. This is also not the best solution, as the responsibility of creating users falls into a particular app. 

	The best solution is to probably create a "core" app which takes care of Users, RFID etc. and the have apps like mess_rating which only deal with the particular usage. But building that right now would be too much work without any guarantee of the work ever being deployed.



Notes on using 3.5 Inch Display :
	The first link worked for me. However, just for the sake of completeness, I am giving other links which might be useful.

Notes on simultaneously using 3.5 Inch Display and MFRC522 Reader:
	MFRC522 Reader uses SPI to communicate with RPi.
		We were using MFRC522-python and SPI-py which used the RPi's SPI Bus 0 Channel 0
	The 3.5 Inch Screen also uses SPI to communicate with reader.
		The 3.5 inch screen probably uses both channels of SPI Bus 0(one for LCD and one for touch)
		Source : 
			http://www.waveshare.com/3.5inch-rpi-lcd-a.htm 
			(Look at interface subsection)
		Even if we disable touch or something, the physical female header of the LCD screen is of 26 pins. We would have to physically break off a few pins to have space to connect wires to MFRC522 Reader.
	RPI SPI
		The raspberry pi has a SPI Bus 1 which has 3 channels. So, technically, we can let the 3.5 inch display use the SPI Bus 0(Both Channels), and have the MFRC522 reader use the SPI Bus 1.
		At this point I read this,
			https://projects.drogon.net/understanding-spi-on-the-raspberry-pi/
			And this comment,
			https://projects.drogon.net/understanding-spi-on-the-raspberry-pi/#comment-582
		Which led me to think that there is no Kernel support for SPI Bus 1 which is there only in RPI 3.
		Further, doing "ls /dev | grep spi" only gave me "spidev0.0" and "spidev0.1" - which are the two channels on bus 1. This strengthened my belief that SPI Bus 1 is not supported in Kernel.
		Then, I found this,
			https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/31934/73776
			http://abyz.co.uk/rpi/pigpio/index.html
			This PIGPIO Library allows control of GPIO pins. Yaaay.
		I set it up, and then started searching for a library for MFRC522 reader that uses PIGPIO. 
			I didnt get a proper library, but I got this code. 
			https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1098821#p1098821
			This guy wrote a module called RC522 which uses PIGPIO to talk to MFRC522 reader.
			I downloaded this and tested it - and it worked.
			NOTE : The RST Pin on MFRC522 Reader is useless. No need to connect it to anything.
		At this point, I found this
			http://elinux.org/RPi_SPI#Linux_driver
			Adding dtoverlay=spi1-1cs  #1 chip select to /boot/config.txt and rebooting,
			I got 3 new spidevices(ls /dev | grep spi). I now had, 
				spidev0.0, spidev0.1, spidev1.0, spidev1.1, spidev1.2
		I felt like a noob - and tried to use MFRC522-python + SPI-py with spidev1.0
			It worked perfectly
	Even after solving the SPI Problem, I was still not done.
		Now, MFRC522 reader uses pins
			MOSI     - 38
			MISO     - 35
			SCLK     - 40
			SDA(CE2) - 36
			GND      - 34
		For 3v3, I am stuck. Because the only 3v3 pin is Pin 1 - and that is blocked by the 3.5 Inch Screen.
		I quickly found a hack - I used Pin 33 - GPIO 13 as a 3v3 supply.
			import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
			GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
			GPIO.setup(33, GPIO.OUT)
			GPIO.output(33, True)  #Supply 3v3 to MFRC522
			GPIO.output(33, False) #Switch off MFRC522 Reader
