Tried to connect screen and reader at same time and work. 
It does not work. 
Basically, the dtoverlays for waveshare35a and spi1-3cs are conflicting in /boot/config.txt
Need to figure this out

Essentially, the device tree overlays of SPI Bus 1 and Waveshare 3.5 inch display are conflicting.
	dtoverlay=spi1-3cs 
	dtoverlay=waveshare35a
The overlay files are stored in /boot/overlays. But they are unreadable device tree blob (dtbo) files that are created by compiling/building device tree source (dts) files
I tried to find the device tree source files for these. And I did.

	https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/blob/rpi-4.9.y/arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/spi1-3cs-overlay.dts
However, I am unable to make any sense of the source so far......

Another option is to not rely on kernel devices for both SPI-O and SPI-1.
Which means using some GPIO library + Userspace code to communicate with 3.5 inch screen or MFRC522 via SPI.
For MFRC522, we already found PIGPIO and the User's code - but using that feels like giving up.

	The first two links talk about how PIGPIO can be used to control SPI1. 
	In third link, a guy has code to communicate with MFRC522 using SPI, using the PIGPIO library for controlling GPIO pins.
	The 4th and 5th link are general pages which contain good info

I found several other nice libraries, but either they didnt work, or had some minor bug which makes them useless.
	This library works amazing for reading touch input - but its only for touch. Not for display.

	Ideally, this should work for display, but I havent figured out how to use it yet.

	This is the blog of the guy who wrote the gfxlcd library - and its awesome

After all this, I took a break. After the break I realized that I have to tackle the problem head on.
I opened up this documentation about Device Tree from Raspberry Pi Website, and started reading the whole thing. It took me about an hour or so, but I got the hang of most of this. If you have only enough time to read one link out of all the links I am sharing - this is the one to read.

25 Sept 2017
Fresh day, fresh start.

Immediately got down into figuring out how to make the boot overlays work without conflict.
Looking at these two files,
	https://github.com/swkim01/waveshare-dtoverlays/blob/master/waveshare35a-overlay.dts
	https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux/blob/rpi-4.9.y/arch/arm/boot/dts/overlays/spi1-3cs-overlay.dts
I realized that,
	waveshare35a-overlay.dts -> fragment@1 -> waveshare35a_pins -> BCM pins = <17 25 24>;
	spi1-3cs-overlay.dts -> fragment@0 -> spi1_cs_pins -> BCM pins = <18 17 16>;
Hypothesis : Even though I am not using SPI-1 Channel 0 and Channel 1, which are by default on BCM Pins 18 and 17, maybe SPI-1 overlay is still using them, and not allowing display to access them. 
I also knew from studying the SPI documentation that the pins for the SPI-1 bus channels can be chosen(http://terminal28.blogspot.in/2016/05/enabling-spi1-on-raspberry-pi-bzero23.html)
Thus, I added the following overlay commands to /boot/config.txt
	dtoverlay=waveshare35a
	dtoverlay=spi1-3cs,cs0_pin=5,cs1_pin=6,cs2_pin=16
And yes - I got both the display and the SPI-1 bus to work.
This was verified by checking the display, and by running "ls /dev | grep spi", which gave spidev1.0, spidev1.1, spidev1.2

I was so happy. I quickly cloned https://github.com/mab5vot9us9a/MFRC522-python, set up everything, and ran it.
The PIN connections I was using is this :
MFRC522 Pin - RPI Physical Pin Number
	SDA  - 36
	SCK  - 40
	MOSI - 38
	MISO - 35
	IRQ  - Not Connected
	GND  - 34
	RST  - Not Connected
	3V3  - 33
I was connecting SDA, SCK, MOSI and MISO to spidev1.2
I was powering the MFRC522 using GPIO 33, since I didnt have a free 3v3 pin.
Before running it, I had to make few changes to Dump.py
	#Tell Dump.py which spi device to use for connecting to MFRC522 reader
	MIFAREReader = MFRC522.MFRC522(dev='/dev/spidev1.2')
	#Add at top to provide power to MFRC522 reader via GPIO 33
	GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)
	GPIO.setup(33, GPIO.OUT)
	GPIO.output(33, True)
Over ssh, I ran "python3 Dump.py", and placed the card. The card details were printed on my screen. However, the 3.5 inch screen instantly died. 
This was a troubling for a few minutes, until I noticed Raspberry Pi warning about "Pin 22 already being in use" and "Continuing anyway" as soon as I run Dump.py.
My guess was that pin 22 was being used by the 3.5 inch screen, and for some reason the MFRC522 library is using it while reading the card. 
A quick look at https://github.com/mab5vot9us9a/MFRC522-python - and I figured out why.
The Pin 22 is the reset pin. I figured out a while ago that the reset pin does pretty much nothing, and the library works fine without it.
Thus, I simply opened up MFRC522.py, and searched for 22. 
	In line 34, I changed "NRSTPD = 22" to "NRSTPD = 32"
	In line 161, I changed "GPIO.setup(22, GPIO.OUT)" to "GPIO.setup(self.NRSTPD, GPIO.OUT)"
	Note : GPIO was set to GPIO.BOARD mode, so 32 is physical pin 32, which is outside of the 26 pins used by display.

Then, all I had to do was clone the django project of mess, setup databases, install pip packages and finally run it.
